# Privacy Policy for Draik Discord Bot

**Effective Date:** [20/JUNE/2025]

This Privacy Policy explains what data the Draik Discord Bot ("Draik", "we", or "our") collects, why we collect it, and how it is used and protected.

---

## Consent

By using the Draik bot in your Discord server or as an individual user, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.

---

## Data We Collect

To provide its full functionality, Draik may collect and store certain information. This includes server IDs, channel IDs, message IDs, user IDs, and usernames with tags (like Example#1234). We also store data related to reminders created by users, custom guild settings, and personal preferences like pronouns. Additionally, if a server admin enables the message logging feature, Draik will temporarily store the content of edited or deleted messages—this is necessary because Discord itself does not make that content available. Please note that all such message data is securely stored in an encrypted database and is only collected when explicitly configured.

---

## Purpose of Data Collection

The information we collect is used solely to provide and maintain the services and features of the bot. For example, storing server and user identifiers allows Draik to remember custom configurations. Reminder and logging features rely on storing relevant data so users can interact with them over time. Message content is only collected if message logging is turned on, and is used to show changes in edited messages or recover deleted content. This helps moderators keep track of important conversations.

> **All logged message content is stored in an encrypted format.**

---

## How We Use the Information

Your data is used only to operate and deliver Draik’s services. This includes running features like reminders, moderation tools, custom settings, and logs. 

> **We never sell, share, or distribute your data to any third party. Your privacy is our top priority.**

## Your Rights

If you would like your data to be removed or have questions about our data practices, please contact us via our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/bGaGFbMqAV).

## Policy Updates

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be published here. Continued use of Draik means you agree to the latest version of this policy.
